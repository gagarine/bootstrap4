This is a minimal drupal theme to integrate bootstrap. 

No settings. No paralaxe. Minimal dependencies. It works.

# How-to use it

- Download
- 'npm install'
- 'npm run build'
- activate the theme

You can checkout the package.json file to see a list of command, but really you certainly ony need 'npm run watch'.

To customize style and bootstrap edit the file in scss/styles.scss

Pull request welcome. But do not lose time building anythings complexe. It's just a theme.
