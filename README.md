# Bootstrap 4 theme for Drupal 8
This is a minimal drupal theme to integrate Bootstrap 4 in Drupal 8.

- Settings free! (if you want to load bootstrap differently, just edit the template).
- Minimal dependencies.
- Works out of the box
- Simple.

## Quick start

Adding the theme in your Drupal installation.
Then build the theme (from inside the theme folder -> yoursite/themes/bootstrap4/):
- 'npm install'
- 'npm run build'

You can read the package.json file to see a list of command, but really you certainly ony need 'npm run watch'.

To customize style and bootstrap edit the file in scss/styles.scss

Pull request welcome. But do not lose time building anythings complexe. It's just a theme.
